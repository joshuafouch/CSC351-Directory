    <h2>My Thoughts on Code Commenting...</h2>

    <p>One of my <i>favorite</i> hobbies is <b>CODING!</b></p> <!--<b> bolds text, <i> italicizes text-->
    
    <div>
        <p>
            Sometimes coding comments can be very tedious and annoying... However, they are very important for documentation!
            <br>I once read from a Catholic book, <cite>Holiness for Everyone</cite> from Eric Sammons on the spirituality of St. Josemaria Escriva.
            <br>It speaks about doing the jobs that no one else notices. Sometimes we become tempted to let simple work slide since it will go unnoticed anyways.
            <br>However, Sammons explains his experience as a computer programmer. Commenting is essential to coding because it <q>might eventually<br> guide
            another programmer making changes to my software.</q> (<i>Holiness for Everyone</i>, Sammons).  <!--citing and quoting in html-->
            <br> Commenting not only strengthens your code, but also makes you more of a hard worker. Commenting teaches you that God desires we do everything, <br>
            whether it is a simple or grand task, be done with <q>enthusiasm and love</q> (<i>Holiness for Everyone</i>, Sammons).
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Anyways, here is an example of a comment in C++:<br>
    <code>

    <h2>My Favorite Saint Augustine of Hippo Quote</h2>
    <p>Here is one of my favorite quotes from <u>St. Augustine of Hippo</u>:</p> <!--<u> underlines text-->

    <div>
    <blockquote
    cite="https://www.vatican.va/spirit/documents/spirit_20020821_agostino_en.html"> <!--this blocks out a section for a quote and cites the link-->
    <pre>   <!--preformats text-->
    <abbr>Thou movest us to delight in praising Thee; 
    for Thou hast formed us for Thyself, 
    and our <mark>hearts are restless till they find rest in Thee.</mark></abbr>   <!--highlights text-->
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>Here is a picture of Saint Augustine because he is a cool guy!</p>
